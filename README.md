# Chess
This is a chess app made in Unity using C#. This project's purpose was to let me learn Unity more comprehensively.
All basic functionality, special moves (En Passant, Castling), checkmate/stalemate are all implemented.
Special draw cases are not implemented (50-move rule, 3-move repetition).
Resetting the board and flipping the board are implemented through buttons.
### Install and Run
If you would like test the app, clone this repository and run Chess.exe in the /Builds folder.
This executable should work for Linux, Mac, and Windows machines, but if it does not, you can manually build this app by downloading Unity version 2022.1.0b10 and build it there.
